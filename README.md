# DataAnalysis
This is a repository of FAKE Databases I generated using top 100 Male and Female names in the USA from 2010. Also using the top 1000 Last names
from the US Military. I then made a python dictionary that holds plausible Hire Dates + Birthday's. I plan to implement this into a spreadsheet generating 
program to then generate a payroll. I then plan to implement a machine learning algorithm to mimic a real data analyst job, this will create graphs and
generate projections based on current numbers/sales per employee. I can then improve the model using isolation and hashmapping to generate cross format
data, meaning that I can create formulas to track progress of individual names or individual teams when implemented properly. Such as if employees who have
been employed for longer really progress better, or projected market on long projections, even if age is a factor vs sales. With fake numbers it's all 
meaningless, but I still plan to make it work. I plan to make categories of work and positional arguments to generate further if I don't get real data
to use.
